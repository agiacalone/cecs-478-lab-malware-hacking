# CECS 478 Lab: Malware

## Assignment description

We're in the section of the class where we discuss malware, and what better way to practice all of the same skill-set of skills than to do some ROM hacking!

You will also need a hex editor / debugger for this assignment. There are some romhacking tools specialized for this purpose (which you are free to use), but I suggest using [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) and giving the NSA's program a spin. That's how I did it. :-)

Plus, of course, a healthy dose of knowledge from classes like CECS 341 or similar architecture class. You will also need to tinker with this assignment: get creative; try things; make an early copy of your ROM file and don't worry about messing it up; experiment; play around with this. Many hackers learn more from *play* than work.

## Some obvious things that shouldn't need to be said, but have to be right now

1. **Don't apply any patches or third-party code to your ROM file** other than the code *you* change. A simple run of a `diff` program will easily tell me which pieces have been changed and which haven't.
2. **Do your own work**. Cheating and plagiarism are at all time highs in our department and we are being extra watchful right now.
3. **Come to me if you need help**. Really. I'm surprised people don't do this *more*. There are some things that I won't be able tell you about, but quite a bit that I can.
4. **Have fun with this assignment**. It's *supposed* to be fun. Hard, yes. But the best puzzles are always the hardest ones ;-).

## Deliverables

Here is what I will need from you:

1. Your modified, runnable (in working order) `metroid.nes` file which will include:
   - Samus's in-game suit changed to purple (NES color code: `0x23` or some other purple-looking one)
   - Your name as hacking credits in the game code, preferably displayed when the game runs
2. A screenshot of the game, with Samus's color change and a unique background image within the game. Something to show that you did this.
3. A write up with the following info:
    - The offsets of the locations changed
    - Which value each offset now contains
    - Your experiences with the project
    - Anything else you want to tell me

Your submission must follow the following rules, *else I will not grade it and you will receive a zero for the submission*:

* Do not use compression on your files
* Make sure that all significant code is *commented* with your own explanations
